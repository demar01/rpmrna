# Shiny Dashboard to visualize RNA and Protein localised to protrusions

===============

Graphical interface to visualize log2(Protein/Cell-bodies) RNA and Protein localization profiles for the paper [Subcellular mRNA localization regulates ribosome biogenesis in migrating cells (Dermit et al., 2019)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/829739v1). 

The Dashboard can be directly accessed in the Shiny Apps webpage: https://clif.shinyapps.io/RPmRNA/.
